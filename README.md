# Web Development @ Technothlon
This is the place where it all started, the love for Web Development. This Repositry contains some of the basic tasks I performed while learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
This Repositry contains:
* __Beginning with tables__ - Some basic tasks on table using hovering tools, etc. [HTML, CSS]
* __Feedback__ - A form to collect feedback it is a very basic form. [HTML, CSS]
* __Hovercard__ - Made a hovercard just using HTML and CSS [HTML, CSS]
* __AppControl Interface__ - This is basically a fully javascript enabled form for doing much more then normal things [HTML, CSS, Javascript]
